<p>A library for creating simple GUIs in introduction-level programming courses.
    The library uses Swing to display the GUI in a window, but it does not expose any
    Swing types or concepts directly; instead, all functionality is exposed using a
    simple, single-threaded, and mostly primitive-type-based API.
<p>The base API uses a single object of type {@link ch.trick17.gui.Gui} and focuses on
    drawing operations and global user inputs. An extended interface allows
    adding "{@link ch.trick17.gui.component.Component}s", which are objects that draw
    themselves on the GUI and can react to local user inputs using simple
    callbacks.
